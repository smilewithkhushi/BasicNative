# @urql/exchange-retry (Exchange factory)

`@urql/exchange-retry` is an exchange for the [`urql`](../../README.md) GraphQL client that allows operations (queries, mutations, subscriptions) to be retried based on an `options` parameter.

## Quick Start Guide

First install `@urql/exchange-retry` alongside `urql`:

```sh
yarn add @urql/exchange-retry
# or
npm install --save @urql/exchange-retry
```
