/**
 * Lets you update the current configuration of the layout animation or shared element transition for a given component.
 * Configurations are batched and applied at the end of the current execution block, right before sending the response back to native.
 *
 * @param viewTag - The tag of the component you'd like to configure.
 * @param type - The type of the animation you'd like to configure - {@link LayoutAnimationType}.
 * @param config - The animation configuration - {@link LayoutAnimationFunction}, {@link SharedTransitionAnimationsFunction}, {@link ProgressAnimationCallback} or {@link Keyframe}. Passing `undefined` will remove the animation.
 * @param sharedTransitionTag - The tag of the shared element transition you'd like to configure. Passing `undefined` will remove the transition.
 * @param isUnmounting - Determines whether the configuration should be included at the end of the batch, after all the non-deferred configurations (even those that were updated later). This is used to retain the correct ordering of shared elements. Defaults to `false`.
